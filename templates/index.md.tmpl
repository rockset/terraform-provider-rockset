# Rockset Provider

The [Rockset](https://rockset.com/) provider is used to interact with the 
[Rockset REST API](https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/) 
via the [Go client](https://github.com/rockset/rockset-go-client)
in order to configure resources of a Rockset organization.

Visit https://github.com/rockset/terraform-provider-rockset to file any issues for bugs or feedback related to the provider,
or visit the [Rockset community site](https://community.rockset.com/).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

~> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for a better alternative.

Creating collections from Rockset's sample datasets, and adding a view that filters out only cities in Brazil.

{{tffile "examples/resources/rockset_s3_collection/resource.tf"}}
```
resource rockset_workspace sample {
  name = "sample"
  description = "sample datasets"
}

resource rockset_sample_collection cities {
  workspace = rockset_workspace.sample.name
  name      = "cities"
  dataset   = "cities"
}

resource rockset_view brazil {
  name = 'cities-in-brazil'
  workspace = rockset_workspace.sample.name
  query = <<SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  commons.cities AS c
WHERE
c.fields.country = 'Brazil'
SQL
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `api_key` - (optional) Your Rockset [API key](https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/#createapikey). If not present it will be sourced from the `ROCKSET_APIKEY` environment variable.
* `api_server` - (optional) Your Rockset API server. If not present it will be sourced from the `ROCKSET_APISERVER` environment variable.

The preferred configuration method is by environment variables, as it doesn't expose the API key in a configuration file.
