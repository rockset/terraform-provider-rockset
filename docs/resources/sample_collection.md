# rockset_sample_collection (Resource)

Manages a collection created from one of the Rockset sample datasets.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource rockset_workspace sample {
  name = "sample"
  description = "sample datasets"
}

resource rockset_sample_collection cities {
  workspace = rockset_workspace.sample.name
  name      = "cities"
  dataset   = "cities"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dataset` (String) Name of the sample dataset, must be one of: causes-of-death, reservations, stocks, cities, movie-ratings, movies, partial-cities
- `name` (String) Unique identifier for the collection. Can contain alphanumeric or dash characters.
- `workspace` (String) The name of the workspace.

### Optional

- `clustering_key` (Block List, Deprecated) List of clustering fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--clustering_key))
- `description` (String) Text describing the collection.
- `field_mapping` (Block List, Deprecated) List of field mappings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping))
- `field_mapping_query` (String) Ingest transformation SQL query. Turns the collection into insert_only mode.

When inserting data into Rockset, you can transform the data by providing a single SQL query, 
that contains all of the desired data transformations. 
This is referred to as the collectionâ€™s ingest transformation or, historically, its field mapping query.

For more information see https://rockset.com/docs/ingest-transformation/
- `retention_secs` (Number) Number of seconds after which data is purged. Based on event time.
- `wait_for_collection` (Boolean) Wait until the collection is ready.
- `wait_for_documents` (Number) Wait until the collection has documents. The default is to wait for 0 documents, which means it doesn't wait.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--clustering_key"></a>
### Nested Schema for `clustering_key`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) The name of a field. Parsed as a SQL qualified name.

Optional:

- `keys` (List of String) The values for partitioning of a field.
- `type` (String) The type of partitions on a field.


<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the field mapping.
- `output_field` (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 1) List of output fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping--output_field))

Optional:

- `input_fields` (Block List) List of input fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping--input_fields))

<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping--output_field"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping.output_field`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) Name of the new field created by your SQL expression.
- `on_error` (String) Specifies the behavior for when there is an error while evaluating the SQL expression defined in the sql parameter. It accepts two valid strings as input: SKIP, which skips only this output field but continues the update, or FAIL, which causes this update to fail entirely.
- `sql` (String) A string SQL expression used to define the new field being created. It may optionally take another field name as a parameter, or a param name alias specified in an input_fields field mapping.


<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping--input_fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping.input_fields`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) Name of the field in your input data to apply this field mapping to.
- `if_missing` (String) Specifies the behavior for when the field evaluates to either NULL or UNDEFINED. It accepts two valid strings as input: SKIP, which skips the update for this document entirely, or PASS, which will simply set this field to NULL.
- `is_drop` (Boolean) Specifies whether or not to drop this field completely from the document as it is being inserted.
- `param` (String) Name alias for this field which can be referred to in a SQL expression in the output_field attribute.
