# rockset_s3_collection (Resource)

Manages a collection with on or more S3 sources attached. Uses an S3 integration to access the S3 bucket. If no integration is provided, only data in public buckets are accessible.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource rockset_workspace sample {
  name        = "sample"
  description = "sample datasets"
}

resource rockset_s3_integration public {
  name         = "rockset-public-collections"
  description  = "Integration to access Rockset's public datasets"
  aws_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::469279130686:role/rockset-public-datasets"
}

resource rockset_s3_collection cities {
  workspace = rockset_workspace.sample.name
  name      = "cities"

  source {
    bucket           = "rockset-public-datasets"
    integration_name = rockset_s3_integration.public.name
    pattern          = "cities/*.json"
    format           = "json"
  }
}
```

When inserting data into Rockset, you can transform the data by providing a single SQL query, 
that contains all of the desired data transformations. 
This is referred to as the collectionâ€™s ingest transformation or, historically, its field mapping query.

For more information see https://rockset.com/docs/ingest-transformation/
- `retention_secs` (Number) Number of seconds after which data is purged. Based on event time.
- `source` (Block Set) Defines a source for this collection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--source))
