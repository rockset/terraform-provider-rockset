# rockset_collection (Resource)

Manages a basic collection with no sources. Usually used for the write api.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for the collection. Can contain alphanumeric or dash characters.
- `workspace` (String) The name of the workspace.

### Optional

- `clustering_key` (Block List) List of clustering fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--clustering_key))
- `description` (String) Text describing the collection.
- `field_mapping` (Block List, Deprecated) List of field mappings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping))
- `field_mapping_query` (String) Ingest transformation SQL query. Requires insert_only to be set to true.

When inserting data into Rockset, you can transform the data by providing a single SQL query, 
that contains all of the desired data transformations. 
This is referred to as the collectionâ€™s ingest transformation or, historically, its field mapping query.

For more information see https://rockset.com/docs/ingest-transformation/
- `field_schemas` (Block List) List of field schemas. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_schemas))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `insert_only` (Boolean) If true disallows updates and deletes, but makes indexing more efficient
- `inverted_index_group_encoding_options` (Block Set, Max: 1) Inverted index group encoding options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--inverted_index_group_encoding_options))
- `retention_secs` (Number) Number of seconds after which data is purged. Based on event time.
- `wait_for_collection` (Boolean) Wait until the collection is ready.
- `wait_for_documents` (Number) Wait until the collection has documents. The default is to wait for 0 documents, which means it doesn't wait.

### Nested Schema for `clustering_key`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) The name of a field. Parsed as a SQL qualified name.

Optional:

- `keys` (List of String) The values for partitioning of a field.
- `type` (String) The type of partitions on a field.


<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the field mapping.
- `output_field` (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 1) List of output fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping--output_field))

Optional:

- `input_fields` (Block List) List of input fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_mapping--input_fields))

<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping--output_field"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping.output_field`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) Name of the new field created by your SQL expression.
- `on_error` (String) Specifies the behavior for when there is an error while evaluating the SQL expression defined in the sql parameter. It accepts two valid strings as input: SKIP, which skips only this output field but continues the update, or FAIL, which causes this update to fail entirely.
- `sql` (String) A string SQL expression used to define the new field being created. It may optionally take another field name as a parameter, or a param name alias specified in an input_fields field mapping.


<a id="nestedblock--field_mapping--input_fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `field_mapping.input_fields`

Required:

- `field_name` (String) Name of the field in your input data to apply this field mapping to.
- `if_missing` (String) Specifies the behavior for when the field evaluates to either NULL or UNDEFINED. It accepts two valid strings as input: SKIP, which skips the update for this document entirely, or PASS, which will simply set this field to NULL.
- `is_drop` (Boolean) Specifies whether or not to drop this field completely from the document as it is being inserted.
- `param` (String) Name alias for this field which can be referred to in a SQL expression in the output_field attribute.

### Nested Schema for `field_schemas`

Required:

- `column_index_mode` (String) Whether to have store or no_store.
- `field_name` (String) The name of a field. Parsed as a SQL qualified name.

- `doc_id_codec` (String) Doc id codec.
- `event_time_codec` (String) Event time codec.
- `group_size` (Number) Group size.
- `restart_length` (Number) Restart length.
