# [BETA] Rockset Provider

**This is a work in progress and is considered a beta at this point in time. No official support provided until GA.**

Visit https://rockset.com/ for more information on Rockset.

Visit https://github.com/rockset/terraform-provider-rockset to file any issues for bugs or feedback related to the provider.

```
// Use env vars ROCKSET_APIKEY and ROCKSET_APISERVER to configure provider.
provider rockset {}
```

## Schema

The preferred configuration method is by environment variables:

`ROCKSET_APIKEY` and `ROCKSET_APISERVER`

At this point in time the only valid option for api server is `https://api.rs2.usw2.rockset.com`

Please secure your Rockset api key and never share it or commit it in plain text to any repository.

Optionally you can configure your api key and api server directly.

### Optional
