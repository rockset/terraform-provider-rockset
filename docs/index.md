# Rockset Provider

The [Rockset](https://rockset.com/) provider is used to interact with the 
[Rockset REST API](https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/) 
via the [Go client](https://github.com/rockset/rockset-go-client)
in order to configure resources of a Rockset organization.

Visit https://github.com/rockset/terraform-provider-rockset to file any issues for bugs or feedback related to the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Use env vars ROCKSET_APIKEY and ROCKSET_APISERVER to configure provider.
provider rockset {}
```

~> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for a better alternative.

Creating an S3 integration and a collection from Rockset's sample datasets.

```terraform
resource rockset_workspace sample {
  name = "sample"
  description = "sample datasets"
}

resource rockset_s3_integration public {
  name = "rockset-public-collections"
  description = "Integration to access Rockset's public datasets"
  aws_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::469279130686:role/rockset-public-datasets"
}

resource rockset_s3_collection cities {
  workspace = rockset_workspace.sample.name
  name = "cities"
  integration_name = rockset_s3_integration.public.name
  source = {
    bucket = "rockset-public-datasets"
    pattern = "cities/*.json"
    format = "json"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `api_key` - (optional) Your Rockset [API key](https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/#createapikey). If not present it will be sourced from the `ROCKSET_APIKEY` environment variable.
* `api_server` - (optional) Your Rockset API server. If not present it will be sourced from the `ROCKSET_APISERVER` environment variable.

The preferred configuration method is by environment variables, as it doesn't expose the API key in a configuration file.

For a list of valid options for Rockset API server visit:

https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/

If no API server is specified the default chosen will be `us-west-2`.
